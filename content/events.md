## Weekly Zoom Meetings

Weekly Zoom meetings are held every Wednesday at 7:00pm. These meetings are hosted by TBO founder Xander Miller or a guest host. These meetings focus on growing the movement, with guidance from David Parker (from Take Back Alberta) and his longtime associates.

Sign up at the "Join Us" link below to receive the Zoom link for these meetings.

## In-person Meetings

Stay tuned! As we collect a membership list with postal codes, we will be able to send introduction emails to members who are geographically close to one another. Members can then organize in-person meetings in their area.
